It also can be useful to smooth the transition to a new master (so that a new master is elected within the retry time). Note that when using this flag: - for a replica set, the driver will trying to connect to the old master for that time, instead of failing over to the new one right away - this does not prevent exception from being thrown in read/write operations on the socket, which must be handled by application Even if this flag is false, the driver already has mechanisms to automatically recreate broken connections and retry the read operations.
